        <h2>History</h2>
        Calkiní comes from the Mayan language and is made up of the words: cal
        «throat», and kin «sun» and the suffix «I», like the preposition «of»
        which means «sun's throat». It is estimated that the settlement of the
        Canul lineage was located in a place called U tuuc caan (a corner of
        heaven), in the current city of Calkiní. This happened between 1441 and
        1443, after the destruction of Mayapán. After this event, the Canul
        founded nearby towns. From then on, Franciscan temples and convents were
        opened. Buildings were erected and Christian images were carved on their
        walls. Despite this, the inhabitants did not lose their Mayan customs
        and beliefs, whose language is still preserved in a good part of the
        municipality. On February 14, 1824, the town of Calkiní was declared a
        village. And in 1858, he adhered to the geography of the State of
        Campeche. Calkiní received its city title on November 30, 1918. Later,
        the surface was covered with schools and parks; spaces for sports and
        recreation were opened.

        <h2>Food</h2>
        There are many typical foods of the area such as "Frijol con puerco",
        "Pan de cazon", the typical "panucho", to name a few, but my favorite is
        seafood meal, since Calkini is near a fishing area there are many dishes
        that involve it. One in particular is a type of fish called "Rubia"
        which is served fried and is delicious.
